SEO and Analytics
  SEO, or Searh Engine Optimization, is crucial to having a website show up organically in an optimal spot in a search engine's results. Search engines, such as Google, utilize "crawlers" to go through sites and analyze if it is a good match for a user's search. Crawling will happen organically, but can also be manually requested. For sites that frequently have new content or updated content (such as news outlets, retailers, etc), frequent crawling is vital so that the search engine knows that those URLs and content exist to show in their search results. Other things that help with SEO are relevant, quality links to and from your websites, and having good HTML structure (ex: only 1 H1 tag). 

  Analytics are important to a website's success because they allow us to see how users interact with the site: where they come from, links they click, areas they hover, and more. Being able to analyze user interaction with a site is vital to improving UX design to make the site intuitive and easy to use. Since user traffic, usage, and sharing affect a site's SEO, having a pulse on how users interact with your site will help improve a site's SEO score.


Ideal Implementation:

- initial thoughts to improve content of site
  - change title to include Zelda and/or Breath of the Wild rather than "hyrulian" since most users who would look at this content wouldn't use that search term
  - include ability to share results of a "big 3" astrology-x-zelda action via social media, ability to download results to phone (as images), email results to user
  - give landing page more descriptive content about what site is for and includes 
  - utilize google analytics to see what people actually use site for
  - make sure site is indexable and crawlable
